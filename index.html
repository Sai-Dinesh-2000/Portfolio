      <h3> REMOVING OF SNOWANDRAIN INASINGLE IMAGE
 USING GUIDED FILTER</h3>
      <p> In this paper, we propose a new rain and snow removal methodthroughusing low frequencypart ofa single
 image. It is based on a key difference between clear background edges andrain streaks or snowflakes,
 low frequency part can obviously distinguish the different properties ofthem. Low frequencypart is the
 non-rain or non-snow component. We modify it as a guidance image,the high frequencypart as input
 image ofguidedfilter, so we get a non-rain or non-snow componentofhigh frequency part and add the
 low frequencypart is the restored image.</p>

      <h3>IMAGE RESTORATION USING MEDIAN FILTERING
 TECHNIQUE</h3>
      <p> Nowadays imageis valuable media usedto analyze the data within it. At some point image which captured
 get obscured and noise from the environmentthis process can reduce the quality ofpicture. In order to
 reducethe noise different filters are used in this work. Existing filters can be used to restoring the image,
 such as Gaussianfilter, Averagefilter, Disk filter, Motion filter and Medianfilter. To obtain the noised
 images different types ofnoises like Salt & Pepper noise, Speckle noise and Poisson noise are used.</p>
